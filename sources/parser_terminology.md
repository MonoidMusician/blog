Just a reference list of terminology.

## Production Rule

A grammar is a bunch of production rules, each of which have a nonterminal on the left and on the right they have a sequence of terminals and nonterminals.

## Nonterminal


## Terminal
A .
Synonymous with [Token].

## Token
See [Terminal].
I will occasionally mix them up when “Token” seems more natural, but theyʼre usually called “Terminals”.
