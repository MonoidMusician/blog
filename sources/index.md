I始m creating my blog here, and I始m trying to encourage my programmer friends here at `cofree.coffee`{style="font-weight: 700;"} to [do the same](blog.html).
This blog will be more focused on programming and mathematics, while my more personal stuff will probably continue to live on my personal website: [https://monoidmusician.github.io/](https://monoidmusician.github.io/).

Of course I始ll need to create an interactive type theory next!
