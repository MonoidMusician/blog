Iʼm creating my blog here, and Iʼm trying to encourage my programmer friends here at `cofree.coffee`{style="font-weight: 700;"} to [do the same](blog.html).
This blog will be more focused on programming and mathematics, while my more personal stuff will probably continue to live on my personal website: [https://monoidmusician.github.io/](https://monoidmusician.github.io/).

Get the behind-the-scenes peek at the [code](https://github.com/MonoidMusician/blog) and my account of the [technologies](technology.html) that go into this blog.

## Ideas/WIP
- Interactive type theory!
- Paradigms:
  - [Why you should believe in HoTT Path Induction as a (Haskell) Programmer](programming_paths.html)
  - Passive stability:

    > Imperative code has no passive stability: all global state is mutable, and small perturbations (say, modifying a prototype) can cause unpredictably large effects down the line, if not carefully managed. Untyped code is especially bad. Carefully managed imperative code may be stable, but this is active stability: it is not inherent to the framework but imposed on top.
    >
    > Functional code on the other hand is not only passively stable, it is anchored down solid. Each building block is given a static, local denotation, and they compose together. You may still need nonlocal knowledge of the code to understand the intent of what everything represents (ahem, boolean blindness), but the local meaning is denotationally clear.

- Data:
  - The Anatomy of ADTs
  - Subtypes/Quotients: Lies told in defense of the Truth
  - Quotients: Lets us have nice cake and eat things too.
- Typeclasses:
  - Fundeps: how they affect defining instances and instance resolution
  - Coercible redesign
