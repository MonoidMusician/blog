There ºs one feature that I wish more of the popular online audio conferencing software would implement: being able to mark users as in the same room so they do not get cross-feed.
The more granular feature would be muting individual participants.

I believe that servers need to mix audio per-user anyways, since they obviously do not get their own mic feedback, so it should not be a problem, right?
