Basically a record of information Iʼve come across.
Provided without warranty or commentary.
Just some pointers to things that worked on my systems.
If you want to try these things out, youʼll have to follow the pointers to understand where they could apply and what they do and what are the risks, &c.
(Tbh most of the risks are pretty low.
But itʼs good to know how to roll it back in any case!)
