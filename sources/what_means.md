## Programming

### API

An API just means an interface.
It is how one side of an abstraction boundary communicates with another.

- REST APIs are ways of communicating with a web server over HTTP(S).
- Regular expression (regex/RegExp) libraries have an API for you to give them a string representation of a regular expression and then they will give you an interface to execute the regexes and get information about matches back from that.
- There are a ton of Web APIs for interacting with the web page in JavaScript
- Most programming languages rely on APIs to do any sort of “interesting” stuff

Donʼt pay attention to what the acronym stands for.
Iʼm sure “Application Programming Interface” once meant something in relation to the words that make it up, but it no longer does in common usage.

“Application” means the least.
Application, program, library – who cares what itʼs an interface for, really.
It could even be a single type, or a collection of types, that get an API.

You should understand “Programming” in contrast with “Binary”.
ABIs are Binary Interfaces and refer to bits and bytes.
APIs, in contrast, are exposed in a programming language.
