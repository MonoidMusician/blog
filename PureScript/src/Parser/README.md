# What is this?
This is a tool for explaining, analyzer, and teaching about LR1 gramars.

# Why?
I was frustrated by the lack of intuitive explanations of LR1 grammars, and decided to build a cool tool with pretty colors to keep your attention.
# What does it do?
You can input an arbitrary grammar and then test against inputs and see what's happening under the hood.

Once you have entered a grammar, you can generate random inputs that match that grammar.
# How does it work?
